A little Userscript for getting more information of users on your followers page. Great for quickly seeing if a blog is inactive, or likely to be a spambot. Tells you their posting activity, and a little bit about the sort of posts they make.

Set-up requires you to get an API key, and to paste it into the code. Tested with Tampermonkey on Chrome with Windows 10 and MacOS.
